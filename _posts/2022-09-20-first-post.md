This is my first post. I am writing today about random things really. I am not sure what I would like this blog to be about, so for now it is about nothing. Maybe I will start at the beginning. When I opened my eyes this morning, (okay so not the very beginning but a beginning nonetheless) I looked over to my left and there lei my angelic man, his thick black eye lashes still, his lips slightly smiling and his hari in complete dissary from a long night. I watch as he sleeps deeply and peacefully and think I am just the luckiest girl in the world. And as though my thoughts pull him out from his slumber, big brown eyes groggily gaze into mine. 

While on our usual morning walk with the hound, we pass some sort of establishment with a kitchen and the we are mesmorised by the smell of potatoes and gravy or atleast that is what this smell reminded me of. We follow the wiff for as long as we can until it is difused into the world and no longer within the reach of our noses.
