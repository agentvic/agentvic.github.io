Good day, and welcome to my second post on the second day of this blog's existence. As I am still uncertain of what to write about, I will just write and see where it goes. Actually I have some questions, Why is it that I can't seem for the life of me to learn German. I want so badly to communicate with those around me but when I open my mouth to speak the vocabulary just escapes me.
